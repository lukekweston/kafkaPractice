# Usage

Follow step 1 and 2 from here

https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart

Download and extract kafka, browse to that directory then run the following commands

(I had to uncomment and set advertised.listeners=PLAINTEXT://<my ip>:9092 in server.properties in the config dir in kafaka to get it to run) 

# Start the ZooKeeper service
$ bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties

# Start the Kafka broker service
$ bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
